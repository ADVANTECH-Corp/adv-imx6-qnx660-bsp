This program reads a touch device for touches and releases
and displays the data.

The touch device should be created by a devi-(touch) resource manager,
for example

    devi-hid -p touch
    
A devi-* resource manager with -p option, simply outputs a _touch2_packet
to its device. 

This output is normally received directly by libmtouch-devi.so when
graphics.conf contains "driver = devi" in the mtouch section.
